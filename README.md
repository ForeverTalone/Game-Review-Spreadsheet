## Game Review Spreadsheet
The *Game Review Spreadsheet* is an Excel spreadsheet designed to help you review your League of Legends replays in a systematic environment. You can track your progress easily and potentially see where games went wrong (or right) with the information that you fill in after each match. The spreadsheet automatically highlights some pieces of important information such as your role, the outcome of the game, and the percentage of CS that you gained over multiple different checkpoints throughout the game (5/10/20/30 minutes).

You're going to need Excel on your computer in order to download and use the spreadsheet. If you don't have Excel, but you'd like the color codes and formulas in order to make a similar spreadsheet on Google Sheets or its ilk, message me on Reddit at [/u/ForeverTalone](https://www.reddit.com/user/ForeverTalone/).
